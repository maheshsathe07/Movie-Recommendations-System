# Movie Recommendation System in R

This project is a movie recommendation system implemented in R language. The recommendation system utilizes the Rotten Tomato dataset to provide movie recommendations to users. The recommendation system employs both collaborative filtering and item-based filtering techniques to generate personalized recommendations.

## Features

- **Collaborative Filtering:** This technique identifies similar users based on their movie preferences and recommends movies liked by users with similar tastes.
- **Item-Based Filtering:** This approach recommends movies similar to those already liked by the user, based on similarity metrics such as cosine similarity or Pearson correlation coefficient.

## Dataset

The recommendation system utilizes the Rotten Tomato dataset, which contains information about various movies including their ratings, genres, release year, and more. The dataset is crucial for training the recommendation algorithms and providing accurate recommendations to users.
